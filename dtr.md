**Shred Share DTR Memo**


**Project:** Shred Share - Ride Share Ski Project


**Group Member Names:** Smitha Hosmani, Nathan Thomas, Kelly Sandeson, Leiya Kenney


**Project Expectations:** What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

**Kelly:** I hope to get a stronger understanding of micro services and api creation and consumption for my own growth and understanding.

**Nathan:** More experience consuming APIs as well as Oauth and integrating a Sinatra microservice.

**Leiya:** I’d like to get more experience with consuming an API, as well as get a better foundational understanding of how building apps works

**Smitha:** Experience Ideation to Completion of a fully functional (MVP) app. More practice with building/consuming an API, RDBMS, AR queries, testing, and best practices.


**Goals and expectations:**

**Kelly:** To hit the MVP we are aiming for as a team as well as the learning goals outlined in the project rubric.

**Nathan:** I also would like to have a project worthy of showing off at code fair, but my main focus is a deep dive into the learning goals. Focusing on better communication and feedback of code before merging into master.

**Leiya:** Like Kelly, I’d like to hit the MVP we’ve outlined, and would love to be able to show our project off at Code Fair

**Smitha:** Have a functioning app that we can display on our Portfolio and discuss at interviews; Collaborative and inclusive team.


**Team strengths:**

**Kelly:** Powerhouse for long blocks of problem solving and feature completeness

**Nathan:** project management, conflict resolution, putting my nose to the grindstone!

**Leiya:** Resourceful, good at communicating and taking a project management standpoint for the team

**Smitha:** research, resourceful.


**How to overcome obstacles:**

**Kelly:** As a team. I would prefer to not need to make decisions on my own when it comes to project related decisions.

**Nathan:** I like a team approach to solving problems, but appreciate time to solo spike in order to get my thoughts together and do my own research so I feel I can contribute in a meaningful way.

**Leiya:** I’d like a cohesive environment when working in general, but especially when dealing with obstacles. Since this is a collaborative effort, I’d like for us to make decisions together about overcoming obstacles - ideally breaking down the components and making sure we all understand why we’re moving forward with what we move forward with.

**Smitha:** I like a balance between pair coding and solo spikes, this helps me process new information better. I don’t usually hesitate to ask for help. Discussing and breaking down problems as a group or in pairs would be ideal.


**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):**

**Kelly:** I will be available during all assigned class work time as well as every day until 6PM.
	- Weekends I have availability Saturdays 10AM - 6PM and Sundays 11AM - 6PM

**Nathan:** Commitments:
  - Job Shadow 10/22 12-4pm
  - Physical Therapy 10/23 8-9am
  - Date Night w/ Camille 10/24 6:30pm (taking the rest of the night off)
  - Halloween 10/31 no plans, but should probably reserve a couple hours for Camille as it is her favorite holiday.
	- I am available from 8am - 10pm every day other than what is posted above.

**Leiya:**
  - I’ll be available weekdays usually from 8am - 7pm
	- With the exception of Saturday evening, I'm free all weekend, but would prefer to have half a day for chores etc.
  - 10/24 - Meeting with mentor @ 5p
	- 10/25 - Need to leave by 6:30p latest
  - 10/26 - Have to leave @ 5:15p for an appointment
	- 10/29 - Attending event @ 5:30p (leave between 5p & 5:15p)

**Smitha:**
  - Very flexible.
  - Available to work in the evenings during weekdays (at Turing).
  - I would prefer to have half the day off (late start) either on Saturday or Sunday.  We can decide that later.
  - I have an appointment on Thursday from 3-4.
  - I haven’t set an appt with my mentor this week, I will update you all when I do.


**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):**

**Kelly:** I will use the Slack Channel and group chat to keep communication open and frequent

**Nathan:** Slack is the best way to get ahold of me. I would also like to make a point of giving better feedback on code and making requests for edits to code on GitHub before merging to master. I think this will lead to cleaner more functional code as well as a chance for us to all to get familiar with and approve of what is going into master.

**Leiya:** I like using both the Slack channels to communicate - I will be checking Slack regularly until 8pm, and will check it if I remember through the evening/early morning. I also think the daily stand-ups will help us keep communication flowing.

**Smitha:** Slack (private channel and group message). Daily stand-ups at the end of the day (in-person or via Slack) discussing project progress and availability.


**Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**

**Kelly:** I can talk out my thought process every step of the way. I would like to use this project as an opportunity to practice mindfulness

**Nathan:** Feel strong with API consumption and CRUD functionality. I would like to practice articulating my thought process as well as diving into building something I am not familiar with.

**Leiya:** I have mostly areas of improvement, honestly. I would like to build my own confidence and my ability to stick with my personal ideas of how things should work, but not at the risk of the project’s success (so like, keep me accountable and encourage me if you think I’m onto something good, otherwise tell me why it’s a bad idea so I don’t keep repeating that mistake)

**Smitha:** I would like to practice articulating my ideas and taking the leap and diving bravely into building features I find challenging


**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**

**Kelly:** I will work on solo features, paired programming assignments and team features.

**Nathan:** Oauth and anything that involves coordinates, locations, and maps. I’m also happy to participate in rounding out my skills by helping to build the front end.

**Leiya:** I’m good to work on any features; I’m sure I’ll have more opinions as the project goes on, but I will say I’d like to do some pair/group programming on and off to have the ability to bounce ideas off others

**Smitha:** I would like the initial set up to be done as a group and break out into pairs. Solo-spikes on topics we all agree we are shaky one and tackle them as pairs. Solo-build features we can or want to.


**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):**

**Kelly:** My expectations are that commits are frequent on relevant branch names with SRP at the heart of Pull Requests with tests written when applicable. No one person will merge Pull Requests and that two people should review a pull request before it is merged into the master branch.

**Nathan:** I like the idea of us all being more diligent in reviewing and making comments on code before it is merged. I would also like for us to practice giving feedback on code and requesting for relevant changes to be made before merges to master take place. If this code is to be reviewed by future employers the way we communicate and give feedback on GH will not go unnoticed.

**Leiya:** Frequent commits with messages per the instructors’ requirements (they’re a little different this time around). I would love if Pull Requests could be merged daily; we can either all get together to merge things, or we can review on our own, add comments, and merge when we have at least 2 others’ support. No one should be merging their own pull requests.

**Smitha:** I would love it if we had group PR reviews; I understand this isn’t always feasible. Perhaps reserve this for big features. Clear and frequent commit messages - something future employers will look for. Detailed PR requests. Thorough code reviews.


**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**

**Kelly:** Specific, Actionable, Kind, Prompt

**Nathan:** Give it to me! Please practice giving constructive feedback from a caring place though.

**Leiya:** Same as Kelly, but I also like a why behind constructive feedback, or information on how I can improve in the future. Also, if I cry, I’m sorry. It’s not a you thing, it’s a me thing. Please bear with me. I do want the feedback to be a better coder, but I’m still working on receiving less-than-glowing critiques :)  

**Smitha:** I am open to feedback provided it is delivered in a professional manner and with empathy. I also expect the same of myself when giving feedback. I believe we are all capable of reading the room and monitoring our own behaviors.
